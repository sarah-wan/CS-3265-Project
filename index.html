			<h3>About the Data</h3>
			<p id="about">
				  This is a countrywide car accident dataset, which covers 49 states of
					the USA. The accident data are collected from February 2016 to June
					2020, using two APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event)
					data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of
					entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law
					enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the
					road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records
					in this dataset. We retrieved the dataset from
					<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents">here</a>.

			<h4>Tables</h4>
			<p id="about">
				For our database, we chose to break the data down into four separate tables:
